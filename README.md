This is terribly out-of-date! Will fix when I get time! (18/09/2018)

Scripts for interactive ESL classroom games.

Some games require additional hardware (simple joysticks, etc.). Look at the included image (joystick.png) for a joystick example; you can buy these at a site like https://www.arcadeworlduk.com. The joystick connects to a keyboard circuit, such that stick movement is converted to key presses.

Games:



1. Fruits and Vegetables Game: Students look at pictures of fruits and vegetables, and then select the correct name using a joystick. Two players.

2. Irregular Verbs in Past Simple Game: Students are shown a verb in the infinitive form, and must choose the correct simple past form.

3. open-cv games: A directory containing a variety of games where students must shoot the correct the answer with a pistol containing a tracking camera.

4. Parts of Speech Game: Students are shown a sentence with a highlighted word, and must choose the correct part of speech for that word.

5. Parts of Speech Game (6 team): Students are shown a word and must select the correct part of speech. Works for up to six teams, whose progress is shown graphically.

6. Timed Words Team Game: A generic game (you add your own vocabulary/lesson data) where students are separated into two teams and must take turns selecting the correct answer by pressing the correct button. The faster a student responds correctly, the more points he/she earns for the team.

7. Sentence Builder: Student must build sentences using the provided fragments.

Some examples are not finished.





1. Weather Game: Students look at pictures of the weather, and also listen to someone talking about the weather. The correct type of weather is chosen using a joystick. Two players.
